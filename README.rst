====================
Using data in cimr-d
====================


If you are looking for processed files, you do not need to clone
the cimr-d GitHub repository. All information you need is
provided in the `catalog.txt`_, which you can download by clicking
the link and viewing raw file or by typing the following in a terminal::

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenelab/cimr-d/master/catalog.txt


Cloning the full repository will not download all data stored in the
`cimr-d` Google Cloud Storage bucket. So you may safely clone the repository to keep a
local copy of the catalog::

    git clone git@github.com:greenelab/cimr-d.git


Frequent pulling is recommended as cimr-d may be updated with new or
improved information::

    cd cimr-d
    git pull


While data processing can be streamlined, any data used in research
studies should be carefully reviewed in the context of its original
publication. To make this as convenient as possible, we provide
doi of each citable publication in the `catalog.txt`_, `.bib` file to be
used in the `bibtex directory`_, and the `full reference`_.



.. _catalog.txt: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenelab/cimr-d/master/catalog.txt
.. _bibtex directory: https://github.com/greenelab/cimr-d/tree/master/doc/bibtex
.. _full reference: https://github.com/greenelab/cimr-d/blob/master/doc/references.md




=====================================
